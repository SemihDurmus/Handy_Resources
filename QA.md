- WHAT IS SASS ?<br/>
- SASS is the short form of Syntetically Awesome Style Sheets. It is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled to CSS. <br/> Advantages of SCSS are: <br/>
  * It enables an easier syntax when styling numerous nested elements under each other.
  * It helps seperating the code into easily managable parts and import them back to main style file.
  * We use "mixins" which are verysimilar to functions in programming languages. So that you do not have to write the same styling code several times. 
  
- WHAT IS CLEAN CODE? 
- Clean code means to write code in a way that everybody can easily read and follow. Or in a way that when you want to turn back to your own code for example after one year you can still grab the code.<br/>
Basic rules here are to write relevant and understandible content, especially when defining variables and function names; and avoid duplication. <br/>
In this manner the code would be more understandable by everyone inclued.
